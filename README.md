## 🧬 Core Stack — What I Use & Love

| Layer       | Tech                                      |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Backend     | Node.js v22 (Jod Mode)                    |
| Frontend    | Vue 3 + Vuetify                           |
| Database    | Neo4j (graph native)                      |
| 3D Engine   | Three.js                                  |
| Web3        | Solana Web3 SDK                           |
| Runtime DNA | ESM · **Minimal-dependency philosophy** 🧘 |

> I build systems that are lean, modern and capable of self-reflection.

## 🧠 Mission: Self-aware Code

> I don’t just build software.  
> I build **systems that analyze themselves**, adapt, and evolve with AI.  
> Every line of code is written for clarity, speed, and meaning.

## 🌿 Tech x Nature: IoT Experiments

Blending machines and the Earth, one leaf at a time 🍃

- ⚙️ ESP32 DevKit V1 projects (WiFi + GPIO + sensors)
- 🌱 Smart garden: monitoring moisture, temperature & air with code
- 🧘‍♂️ Organic design meets algorithmic logic
- Future: energy-aware systems, natural automation

> Nature doesn’t rush, yet everything gets done. So does my code.

---

## 🤖 LLM + Code Collaboration

LLMs aren’t just tools — they’re teammates.

- 🔍 Projects scan and document themselves (`brain.js`)
- 📂 JSON memory maps for routes, components, exports
- 🧠 Designed for integration with GPT, Claude & friends

> If the code knows itself, it can grow by itself. 🪄

---

## 🔐 Security-First Mindset

> 💡 I build software with a “0 known vulnerabilities” policy.

- 🧼 Clean `npm audit` at every commit
- ⚠️ No shady packages, no bloat, no abandonware
- 📦 Minimal-dependency philosophy — trust is earned, not assumed
- 🔒 Designed to be AI-parseable and **human-auditable**

> Stable. Lean. Safe. By design.

## 🧪 Secondary Stack — I Can Build With:

| Tech Area        | Frameworks & Tools                              |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Frontend         | React · Angular · Svelte · TailwindCSS          |
| Backend          | Express · Fastify · NestJS · Laravel · .NET C#  |
| Data & Infra     | PostgreSQL · MongoDB · SQLite · Firebase        |
| DevOps & Tools   | Docker · CI/CD · GitHub Actions · Nginx         |
| Languages        | Python · C# · TypeScript · Bash                 |

> I adapt fast — because not every client picks the best stack 😅

## 🚧 Mini-Labs (In Progress)

Each tech deserves its own little beast. Here's what I'm cooking:

| Lab         | Stack                         | Goal                            |
|-------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `node-jod`  | Node.js v22 (native)          | Minimal backend + self-awareness |
| `vue3-jod`  | Vue 3 + Vuetify               | Clean, dynamic UI architecture  |
| `react-lab` | React + Vite                  | Component testing + state labs  |
| `dotnet-lab`| C# + .NET API                 | Enterprise-ready backend        |
| `neo4j-lab` | Neo4j                         | Graph logic & relationships     |
| `ai-buddy`  | Python + OpenAI               | Local LLM tools & API helpers   |
| `iot-garden`| ESP32 + MQTT + sensors        | IoT system for nature interfaces|
